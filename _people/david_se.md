Davidâ€™s research focuses on the use of 3D-printed bone scaffolds in the surgical treatment of critical-sized bone defects. Under the supervision of Dr. Martineau and Dr. Rosenzweig, he is developing and characterizing a novel scaffold design that offers intraoperative modularity as well as patient specificity.

David received a B.Sc. in biochemistry in 2015 and an M.D. in 2019, both from McGill University. He will soon begin his orthopaedic surgery residency training at McMaster University. His research is funded by the McGill University Health Centre Research Institute (RI-MUHC) Studentship award and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Masters award.

He is currently an Orthopaedic resident at McMaster University.
